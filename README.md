# SQL-Projects
Project Overview:

This repository houses two distinct projects focusing on data analysis using SQL queries followed by visualization using Power BI. The projects revolve around exploring datasets structured according to the classic model of MySQL and the Maven Movies dataset. Through SQL analysis and Power BI visualization, these projects aim to derive insights and present them in an intuitive manner.

Project 1: MySQL Classic Model Dataset Analysis

In this project, SQL queries are employed to analyze a dataset structured according to the classic model of the MySQL database. The analysis encompasses various SQL operations such as extraction, filtering, aggregation, and joining to derive meaningful insights from relational data.

Key Highlights:

Utilization of SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis.
Aggregation functions for summarizing information across different dimensions.
Joins and subqueries to integrate data from multiple tables.
Detailed documentation of SQL scripts and analysis findings.
Project 2: Maven Movies Dataset Visualization with Power BI

The Maven Movies dataset visualization project focuses on creating dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI. The dataset contains information about movies, and Power BI is leveraged to visualize various aspects of this data, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights effortlessly.

Key Highlights:

Creation of visually appealing dashboards using Power BI.
Implementation of interactive visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps.
Integration of multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis.
In-depth documentation of visualization design choices and insights derived.
